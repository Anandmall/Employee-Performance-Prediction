            Any business's success depends on its employees. Businesses that realize this are concerned
            about employee output and productivity. Productivity has a compounding effect at the different
            levels in the workplace, meaning that high productivity at a lower level paves the way for
            higher productivity at the top. Hence, analysis of employee performance is the need of the hour.
